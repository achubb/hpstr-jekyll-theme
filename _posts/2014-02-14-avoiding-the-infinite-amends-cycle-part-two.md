This is the second and concluding part of my article about what I have termed the "**Infinite Amend Cycle**" and how to cope with it as a developer. Part one of this article is available <a href="/avoiding-the-infinite-amends-cycle-part-one/">here</a>

## Testing
This is it, we're at the testing phase. Fasten your seatbelt.

The best tip I can give is this: Try and maintain as much control as you can over testing. Do not, whatever you do, upload the site somewhere, spam the the links around and say "*Here it is, take a look!!!*" This will cause two things to happen:

1. A few people pick up the mail. They have a click around, usually followed by "*Looks good, when is it going live?*". This achieves nothing from a testing perspective. If you can, try and break it up a bit when you are sending out links for review (i.e. "*Here is the blog page, what do you thing about the format of the news stories? Try the categories out, see how they filter?*"). You probably won't get feedback on every point, but it will force the user to at least give it some thought. If they do see a problem, they will let you know about it.
2. The other extreme - people go nuts. "*I have taken a look at the site, here is my 70 page excel doc of amends*". OK, we weren't ready for this. But lets face it 30% could be "*Social Links incorrect on this page*". Some organisations love to work in this way, lists, spreadsheets etc. But they can be a nightmare for developers. You best bet is to play to their strengths, even pre-empt things in your initial email ("*Please note, social links have not been set up yet*"). Better yet prepare a list of tests or questions for the client, if they are more inclined to work this way. They will follow the paper trail, because they feel comfortable working in this way.

Now, I know all to well that when you reach the testing phase of the project, you are getting pushed for time, the go live date is looming. But the testing phase can make or break the project. Don't just sit back and let the amends roll in, pre-empt and test smart.

## What to do when you are in amend hell?
OK, so you may already be in amend hell, maybe you inherited a project, maybe the site is already live and the amends have suddenly piled in. What can you do?

The first thing I would recommend is speak with your account and project managers, make sure that they are aware of the amends and the time they will take to complete. They may decide some are out of scope, or will help prioritise them. They may be able to reach a compromise with the client which leaves both parties happy. They usually have a more leverage in these situations than it would first appear.

Another important step to take here is to document all of the amends, in one central place. This will benefit everyone as it keeps everyone up to date, it gives a rough visual indication of the amount of work left to do. You can also choose to limit the amends done in a sprint, or split them up. This makes them much more workable than trawling your way through one mega-list of amends.
This final pre-live stage of the development process can be arduous at times, and for many developers it is just something they need to get through. No doubt you have either encountered a scenario like this, or you likely will at some point in your career. 

The guide that I have aimed to write here is very much from the developer point of view, remember others on your team may have different goals, and you need to be aware of them. Most importantly you need to take control of this project phase, and ensure that you get the most out of it.
