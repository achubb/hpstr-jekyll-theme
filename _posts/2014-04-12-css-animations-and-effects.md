I have been looking at collating a list of CSS animation styles and effects for a while now. Being a former Flash developer, I always felt that tasteful animations and transitions can add to a site and give it some personality. They are easy to implement, and now with CSS they can be made consistent too. I think in the future animations and transitions could well make up part of the brand palette. There are quite a few nice effect libraries taking shape out there now. Here are some of my favourite resources.

## Effect.css
As it states in the header. *Not quite ready for prime time*. I think that it is worth remembering this for pretty much all of the effect libraries listed here. They are best used quite sparingly and as an enhancement, rather than any crucial functionality effects. Effeckt.css is an excellent directory of CSS3 effects from around the net, from places such as [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops/) and [CSS-Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/) (*the full list of contributors can be seen at the bottom of the page*), this bare-bones page approach really shows how the animations perform when used in a raw state. Also this page is very useful for device testing these effects quickly. [link](http://h5bp.github.io/Effeckt.css/)

## Hover.css
This is a collection of hover effects, with a SASS source. Again the author Ian Lunn deserves great credit for this simply designed showcase page. I really like these subtle effects and I think they can be used as an enhancement to most sites. [link](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

## Animate.css
A nice range of animations and text effects here too. Some of these are quite intense but a good indicator of what can be acheived. Check the github page for details on the grunt custom build options. [link](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

## Codrops Playground
As the title suggests, much of the animations and effects that are being showcased here are prototypes, but I find that they can be a good source of inspiration when coming up with animations and effects to use with your own work. The quality of the code is really good here too, often nicely commented and sometimes even a full blown tutorial. [link](http://tympanus.net/codrops/category/playground/)

## Easings.net
This is a brilliant collection of many of the common animation effects. Ever wonder what an EaseInOutCirc actually does? Wonder no more. Pretty much all of the easing transitions have been documented here, along with a nice graph showing the animations Bezier curve. A great resource. [link](http://easings.net)

## Caesar
[The Caesar Easing Animation Tool Website](http://matthewlein.com/ceaser/), is a great resource that allows you to create your own animation transitions by modifying the curve of the animation right there on the page. You can test the effect out on different properties such as movement, resizing and opacity. Not only that the css animation code is generated right there for you. Also worth mentioning here is the excellent [Compass Caesar Easing plugin](https://github.com/jhardy/compass-ceaser-easing), which allows you to pass the common easing patterns on Easings.net into your transitions.
