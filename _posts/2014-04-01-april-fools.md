I love tech company April Fools, just a round up of the best ones from today for those that might have missed them, sans the many, many flappy bird related ones.

**Blizzard** announced the game Blizzard Outcast. Which looks like an arcade fighter with a very well crafted web page. Featuring a matchmaker service that boasts "For the right price, the Outcast Matchmaker will put you in the ring with an opponent who has zero chance against your skills." and the peripheral with integrated credit card slots for quick micro-transactions.

The free upgrade to **Tumblr**, Tumblr Pro was released, giving users' their own top hat avatars. Confusing to many, they added a partiularly clever video about Pro Member Perks, when you "made the jump". [Link](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/tumblr-pro)

Browser manufacturer **Opera** released their browser optimized for cats. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmxDXhU8CfE).

**Google Japan** unveiled their "Magic Hand" creation, which is a robotic hand, operated by a human with a joystick, which is used to control touch screen devices. Some serious effort has gone into this. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u1zoaJYAmw).

And of course **iFixit** getting acquired by **Apple**. Particularly funny if you've heard the [ongoing feud](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/28/ios_repairs/) between the two parties.[Link](http://www.ifixit.com/apple_press_release).
