Disclaimer - I do most of my work on Windows and Linux machines, and am mainly a PC guy, I like applications that are lightweight (free of bloat) and specifically suited to purpose. I don't mind doing a bit of legwork to get something working for free (I find it disappointing if a paid solution does not work out of the box). This is a list of the software that I use myself and would recommend.

## OS - Ubuntu 13.04
Canonical has done an excellent job of providing a stable and usable Linux desktop. It is ideal for development in the open source world with things like Git, Ruby etc getting rolled in to main OS. [Link](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

## Media - VLC Player
Possibly the best example of open source software out there (IMO). Will play anything and everything you throw at it, cross platform (Win/Mac/Lin). Fast and stable, user friendly UI. [Link](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

## Amp Stack - XAMPP
While there are a few of these amp stacks out there, the one I use is XAMPP. Run by not-for-profit Apache Friends. This has been a stable cross-platform (Win/Mac/Lin) staple for me. [Link](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)

## Browser - Mozilla Firefox
Possibly controversial choice here, but again an excellent example of open source, it's library of extensions and plug-ins is fantastic. The work the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/foundation/) do is also vital to the continuing development of open source. [Link](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html)

## VM - VMWare Player
Steady and easy to use VM solution if you are OS/Browser testing. [Link](http://www.vmware.com/products/player/)

## Office - Libre Office
This free office suite almost feels like full on MS Office 2010 for me, probably not a direct replacement for advanced users of office, but for the odd letter and spreadsheet, it is more than up to the job. [Link](https://www.libreoffice.org/)

## Text Editor - Sublime Text
OK this one is not free, nor open source. This is one I would pay for, there are many extensions and packages that can help you to customise it to your exact needs (I don't know of any other closed source software that is like this). Cross platform also seems flawless. You can have an unlimited evaluation of the product if you don't wish to buy it. It's free alternative is probably vim. [Link](http://www.sublimetext.com/)

## FTP - Filezilla
Been around for years, this has everything you need in an FTP program, never lets me down. Have used it as an ftp server in the past too. Open Source and Free. [Link](https://filezilla-project.org/)

## File Compression - 7zip
Open source file compression/decompression software. Again should meet the basic needs of most users, it does have a Linux port, not sure about OSX. [Link](http://www.7-zip.org/)

## Screenshots - Greenshot
This is an open source windows tool for annotating screen shots. It is lightweight and has a ton of useful features. It's Linux alternative would be [Shutter](http://shutter-project.org/). [Link](http://getgreenshot.org/)

## Remote Desktop - RealVNC
Good free cross-platform VNC tool. [Link](http://www.realvnc.com/download/)

## Cloud Storage - Dropbox
While there have been quite a few new entrants into this market I still think Dropbox has the best balance of features and simplicity. Very versatile. You can possibly get up to 18gb free. Works flawlessly on many platforms. [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/)

## Other programs of note
[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) - Free SSH and Telnet client for Windows.

[Foxit Reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/Secure_PDF_Reader/) - Free PDF reader, less bloated and less updates than Adobe.

[Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/) - Open source video encoder.

[ImgBurn](http://www.imgburn.com/) - Free, lightweight, disc burning app for Windows.

[Meld Diff Viewer](http://meldmerge.org/) - Good, clear diff viewer, cross platform.
