One of my aims for this blog moving forward is to document some of the day to day tasks and issues that I encounter, and offer my own opinion on how to tackle these problems in a fast moving, agency type environment. One of the main areas that I have struggled with since becoming a developer is what I have called the **Infinite Amend Cycle**.

Some of you may well recognize this, it is one of the most common pitfalls for developers and one of the biggest causes of headaches at agencies and development houses worldwide. Developing for clients, can be rewarding but by it's nature can be very consuming. Especially if you are working closely with a client, and allowing them to be involved in the work-flow. It's all too easily done. You start out with the best of intentions, and end up praying that each amend or fix will be the last, and you can get the project out the door.

My tips for avoiding this come from a developer's point of view, and there will be project managers and producers out there who have their own tactics and strategies for dealing with these situations. However if you are developer, tasked with producing something in a set amount of time, then these may be of use to you.

## Be Prepared
This one may seem obvious, but remember how tempting it can be to jump into a new project feet first. That new tech you've been itching to try out... This could be the one that sets you apart, wins you the recognition of your peers... Exceeds your PM's wildest expectations... And so on. I know, I've been there many times. But what you must remember is this, use your passion to drive you on, but don't let it cloud your judgement. Try and think laterally about the project you are about to take on. Ask yourself; Is this the right platform for this? How could I achieve this if I only had half the time? Try to identify potential areas where you may get stuck, and research into how you may go about tackling those.

The key to this approach is to force yourself to identify any pitfalls, you may hit later down the line, as this is the kind of thing that can kick off the Infinite Amend Cycle. Don't be a hero, remember code that ships will win you more respect, where it matters. There will be a time and a place to flex your coding chops.

## Plan Ahead
The other aspect I wanted to touch upon here is planning. Planning is arguably something that comes easier with experience, however if there was one element I would identify as being crucial to avoiding the <abbr title="Infinite Amends Cycle">IAC</abbr>, it would be planning. Spend time reading though the spec and looking at site-maps/visuals, and if there is anything that you are even *slightly* unsure about, or that might not make sense to you. Ask. Kick it back to the PM if necessary. You do yourself more harm in the long run if you just plough on hoping to "*Figure it out as you go along*" or "*Crossing that bridge when you get to it*". This may feel wrong at the time, it may seem as though you are being needlessly pedantic, instead of just getting on with things. After all you're meant to be a dynamic self-starter right? At least that's your CV strap line. That's what bothered me initially, but I learned the best way to be dynamic is to communicate and take the right action when it's needed.

It is worth the any slight annoyance now, rather than the fallout later on in the project, when it becomes apparent nobody picked up on a crucial part of the project, been there, done that, and it ain't pretty. Do yourself a favour, ask the right questions and be proactive.

## Staging
OK, so your mid-way through a project, the client is getting anxious, the Account Manager is sweating the cost, the Project Manager the time. Then comes the inevitable "*Can we put something up for them to have a look at?*" Panic usually ensues.

Once you reach this point, it is almost inevitable that you open the door to amends, fixes and feedback. Whether you feel ready for them or not! So what can you do at this stage...

Well, there are a few options; You could refuse. Radical, and you would need a pretty good reason. But there may well be times when putting up some half finished code could cause more harm than good. Obviously diplomacy and tact is the name of the game here. You have to give good reasons, but it can be done and can be the right thing to do in some situations.

Another tip is here is, as soon as you hit this point, it is worth spending a little time doing some "*light finesse*". By this I mean tidy up a bit, smooth off some rough edges, don't leave loads of alerts and todo notes everywhere. This makes your PM and the client feel as though the project is progressing, without it looking like you just threw it together in 5 minutes on your way in. It will also prevent the onset of early amends. For example if a certain font is to be used for a block of text, code it in before anyone sees it. It is the simple obvious stuff that often kicks off epic amends lists. Try and pre empt anything obvious.

Don't give away too much. If possible let your work be seen at the stages that YOU are happy with it. There is nothing to be gained by constantly pushing changes to a dev server somewhere, and then the link sent out to 300 people, all sat poised at their keyboards, ready to get their two-penneth in. Sometimes you cannot avoid this, and the conditions of the project may mean you have to work in this way. But as long as you can gain the confidence of your team and the client, then they should be satisfied to see the work when you are ready.
