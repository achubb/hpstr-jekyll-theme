Hi, I'm Andrew Chubb a creative Front End/Media developer based in Manchester, UK. Currently Senior Front End Developer at [Cube3](http://wearecube3.com) in Manchester, with a keen interest in creative development across all platforms. I am primarily a Front End Developer, but I also contribute to many other areas crucial to project development, including Media, UX, Design and Planning/Strategy.

I label myself as a "creative" developer, as I see my main strengths as working with designers, UX/UI developers, project managers and clients to create the best results. In my 6 years developing for the web, I have produced a variety of large and small scale projects for clients such as Asda, Cash Generator, Revolution Bars and the National Football Museum. My work is blending creativity with technological know-how, combined with platform and performance awareness to produce unique, engaging experiences.

I spend a lot of my development time in the core elements of web development. Standards based, clean, browser supported HTML. Producing optimised, clean, DRY[^1] CSS, and browser compatible JavaScript, utilising tools such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) amongst many others. I also strive to maintain good development practices, maintaining up to date repositories (git), producing documentation, and working with browser developer tools (FireBug/WebInspector/IEDevTools) to identify and fix bugs.

I am also experienced in the development of HTML emails, both transactional and promotional, and am familiar with the build and testing ([Litmus](http://litmus.com/)) procedure.

I have extensive experience with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), producing commercial grade sites. I have also developed on other platforms such as ExpressionEngine and PyroCMS as well as content management systems based on PHP frameworks such as [CodeIgniter](http://ellislab.com/codeigniter) and [KohanaPHP](http://kohanaframework.org/). I am also familiar with the structure of [Magento](http://magento.com/) and have produced themes for this platform.

The majority of my work has been on open source platforms, so I regularly work with Apache and nginx servers as a result, which involves uploading sites, migrating databases (MySQL, mostly), and basic domain management. Being a bit of a Linux geek too I am comfortable on the command line.

Outside of development I always try and maintain involvement in other areas, providing advice and assistance for design and UX. My experience allows me to assist with project estimation and scoping requirements. I have also produced offline media, animation and video and am familiar with these workflows/procedures.

In my free time I am a bit of an OS\Hardware hobbyist. I enjoy playing around with Linux\Android and <s>breaking</s> upgrading my many devices. I am slowly learning VIM, gradually assembling the perfect home cinema, frantically <s>procrastinating</s> writing blog articles and reading.
