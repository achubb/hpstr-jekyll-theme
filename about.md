Hi, I'm Andrew Chubb a Web Developer focused mainly on the Front End based in Manchester, UK. Currently a Developer at [Dinosaur](http://dinosaur.co.uk), with a keen interest in creative development across all platforms. I am primarily a Front End Developer, but I also contribute to many other areas crucial to project development, including Media, UX, Design and Planning/Strategy.

As an established agency-side developer, I feel comfortable in this environment. I see my main strengths as working with designers, UX/UI developers, project managers and clients to create the best results. In my 7 years developing for the web, I have produced a variety of large and small scale projects for clients such as Asda, Cash Generator, Revolution Bars and the National Football Museum. Blending creativity with practical, technical knowledge, combined with platform and performance awareness to produce unique, engaging experiences.

I spend a lot of my development time in the core elements of web development. Standards based, clean, browser supported HTML. Producing optimised, clean, DRY[^1] CSS, and browser compatible JavaScript, utilising tools such as [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) and [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) amongst many others. I also strive to maintain good development practices, maintaining up to date repositories (git), producing documentation, and working with browser developer tools (FireBug/WebInspector/IEDevTools) to identify and fix bugs. I am also familiar with version control, in particular [git](http://git-scm.com).

I am also experienced in the development of HTML emails, both transactional and promotional, and am familiar with the build and testing ([Litmus](http://litmus.com/)) procedure.

I have extensive experience with [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/), producing commercial grade sites. I have also developed on other platforms such as ExpressionEngine and PyroCMS as well as content management systems based on other PHP frameworks. I am also familiar with the structure of [Magento](http://magento.com/) and have produced themes for this platform.

More recently I have been making the move into full-stack Python development. In particular working with the [Django](http://djangoproject.org) framework. I am also learning other tools that are part of this development stack, such as [PostgeSQL](http://postgresql) and [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com).

The majority of my work has been on open source platforms, so I regularly work with Apache and nginx servers as a result, which involves uploading sites, migrating databases (MySQL, mostly), and basic domain management. Being a bit of a Linux geek too I am comfortable on the command line.

Outside of development I always try and maintain involvement in other areas, providing advice and assistance for design and UX. My experience allows me to assist with project estimation and scoping requirements. I have also produced offline media, animation and video and am familiar with these workflows/procedures.

In my free time I am a bit of an OS\Hardware hobbyist. I enjoy playing around with Linux\Android and <s>breaking</s> upgrading my many devices. I am slowly learning VIM, gradually assembling the perfect home cinema, frantically <s>procrastinating</s> writing blog articles and reading.
