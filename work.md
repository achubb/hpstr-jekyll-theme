### I've been able work with some exciting clients, from small startups to large businesses, developing sites, interfaces and other media helping to create, and maintain intgrated digital experiences. 

Since a lot of my work is more of a constant process, and I find myself moving more and more with advances in web technology. I have found it difficult to maintain a traditional "*portfolio*". Also there are elments of my work that are more internal, or more B2B oriented. So here are some of clients that I have been actively working with.
